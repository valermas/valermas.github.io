Deeply passionate about climate physics, statistical and dynamical properties of rare and extreme climate events, disordered and complex systems. 

Profoundly intrigued and concerned about the societal, environmental and health impacts of climate change. 

Coordinator of the <a href="https://edipi-itn.eu/projectearth/">EArtH</a> project: bridging art and climate by reimagining art masterpieces under the effects of climate change.

Enthusiastic about art history, baking, swimming and running.

*But I also have faults.*
