**Deeply passionate** about climate physics, **statistical and dynamical properties of rare and extreme climate events**, disordered and complex systems. 

Profoundly intrigued and concerned about the **societal, environmental and health impacts** of climate change. 

Coordinator of the <a href="https://edipi-itn.eu/projectearth/">EArtH</a> project: bridging art and climate by reimagining art masterpieces under the effects of climate change.

Enthusiastic about art history, baking, swimming and running.

*But I also have faults.*
